# Task 2

## Project Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data analysis and/or machine learning workflows. The main objective is to explore a dataset, perform preprocessing, apply analytical methods or machine learning algorithms, and evaluate the results. The notebook guides the user through each step, making it useful as a learning resource or as a starting point for similar projects.

## Project Structure

- `task2.ipynb` : The main Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis and code.
- `data/` : (Optional) Folder containing input datasets (if present).
- `output/` : (Optional) Any output files or results generated by the notebook.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**
   - The notebook begins by importing essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. These are used for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

2. **Loading the Dataset**
   - The dataset is loaded into Pandas DataFrames. The source can be a local file (CSV, Excel, etc.) or an online dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - The notebook explores the dataset with descriptive statistics, data summaries, and visualizations (histograms, boxplots, pairplots, etc.).
   - This helps in understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships in the data.

4. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection, and scaling/normalizing data.
   - The notebook provides code and commentary for each preprocessing step.

5. **Model Building** (if applicable)
   - Selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Classification, Clustering).
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Fitting the model to the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation** (if applicable)
   - Predicting on the test set and calculating evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, RMSE, etc.
   - Visualizing model performance with plots (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.).

7. **Conclusion & Next Steps**
   - Summary of findings.
   - Suggestions for improvement or further analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries (see requirements below).
3. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Google Colab.
4. Run each cell sequentially.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Notes

- If a dataset is required, ensure it is present in the `data/` folder or update the notebook with the correct path/source.
- The notebook is intended as an educational tool and a foundation for more complex analyses.
